# youbot
Some discord servers don't allow imbedded links, this is for finding a youtube videos title without clicking the actual link.
# usage
Be sure to look through the code, replace the {channl.id}'s with the channel ID for the channels, example (#general), right click and copy ID and replace it.
You will need your discord token, once you have that replace it in the authorization key.
